# Defiant Project Roadmap

*Defiant* has a complicated mission.  We are trying to assemble many unique projects into a common framework.  We are starting from scratch and bootstrapping it as we go.  That means that things that should be here aren't yet, and things that are indispensible we haven't even gotten around to stubbing out yet!

This document is a mini-roadmap so that you can jump in and know where we need help in development.  We will also try to include implementation notes so that you can see the direction we are striving for (although, like any complicated project, the details will probably change as we progress).

The issues shown here are in roughly the order that we plan to address them, because later features will often depend on earlier features.  If you see something that you want to work on, however, there is nothing stopping you from working on anything that interests you!
